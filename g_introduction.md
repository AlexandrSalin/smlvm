# G Language Introduction

## If you are a Go programmer

G is very similar to Go, almost a almost a strict subset. Thus G is not a new languge for you.

including *memory allocation*, *refelction*, *map*, *chanel* and so on. We are not working on supporting *interface* in G.

struct, interface declaration
