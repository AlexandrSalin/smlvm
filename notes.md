- to build with repos, we need to dynamically load imported repos.
- this requires some support from the build system.
- because loading frmo repos is an async procedure.
- unless we parse the import structure on the backend, which includes parsing
- not really, it only parse the import.g file or the only file in the repository
- so, what we need is a build.Home built from the repo content.
- and parse out the building tree based on the database.
- the package dependency graph.
- after that, we can then send the snapshot of all the packages required back to the frontend

- asm/builtin should always be builtin, even when it is provided as a file.
- currently we load all packages in one step, rather than in two steps.
- this is probably not the best way
- like golang also has a loader
